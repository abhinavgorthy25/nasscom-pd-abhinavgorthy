# NASSCOM Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning 

I came across this workshop in LinkedIn from Kunal Ghosh and this is a two-week Digital Soc and Physical design course using Open Lane a platform that uses open-source tools to generate digital designs from RTL to GDSII. The PDK used in this workshop is also one of the Open sources- PDKs Sky water 130. 



## Aim of the Workshop 
The workshop aims to design a macro (CPU CORE) named picorv32a from one of the ICs used in the VSD Squadron made by VLSI System design (VSD). This is a development board based on the RISC-V architecture. This resembles Arduino Uno development boards and can be used in Home Automation, IoT and many other applications.
